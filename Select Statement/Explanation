# ðŸ“˜ SELECT Basics â€“ Line-by-Line SQL Query Explanation

This file provides a **detailed explanation** for each SQL query written in the file `01_SELECT_Basics.sql`. Each query demonstrates a unique concept of the `SELECT` statement, including how to retrieve full data, specific columns, perform calculations, and filter out duplicate rows.

## ðŸ”¹ Query 1: Select All Columns

````markdown
```sql
SELECT * FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_demographics;

---

## ðŸ”¹ Query 2: Select Specific Columns + Perform Calculations

````markdown
```sql
SELECT first_name, 
       last_name, 
       birth_date,
       age,
       (age + 10) * 10 + 10 AS modified_age
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_demographics;
```

âœ… **What it does:**  
Selects specific columns (`first_name`, `last_name`, `birth_date`, `age`) from the table  
and creates a new column by performing a calculation on `age`.

ðŸ’¡ **Calculation Logic:**  
```text
(age + 10) * 10 + 10
```
- Add 10 to the current age  
- Multiply the result by 10  
- Add 10 again  
This creates a **dynamic transformation** of the age field.

ðŸ§  **Why use this?**  
- Forecast future values (like projected age).  
- Convert or scale values (e.g., tax, discounts, scores).  
- Apply business logic directly in your query.

ðŸ“Œ **Real-world use cases:**  
- Calculating future salaries or growth predictions  
- Currency/unit conversions  
- Applying formulas directly in reports
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, gender 
FROM parks_and_recreation.employee_demographics;
```

âœ… **What it does:**  
Returns only **unique combinations** of `first_name` and `gender`.  
Duplicates are automatically removed from the output.

ðŸ§  **How DISTINCT works:**  
It compares **all selected columns together** â€” in this case, both `first_name` and `gender`.  
Only unique rows for this pair will be returned.

ðŸ§© **Why is this helpful?**  
- Avoids repeated values in reports  
- Useful for clean dropdown lists and filters  
- Helps summarize and group unique combinations

ðŸ“Œ **Examples:**  
- List of unique departments, roles, or categories  
- Get unique locations or countries from customer data  
- Filter duplicates in survey or feedback forms
